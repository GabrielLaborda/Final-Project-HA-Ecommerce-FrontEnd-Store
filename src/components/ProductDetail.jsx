                <p>PARADISE BAMBOO COLLECTION</p>
                <p>Nothing says Sector 9 Bamboo quite like colorful, island vibes. We wanted to revive some of our Bamboo roots (get it?... ‘cause it’s a weed) and thought someone living the island lifestyle would be ideal for creating this collection. With that in mind, we’ve once again collaborated with waterman and artist Kenny Vidinich, head of OneVibe Creative Studios, which is located on the waters of Maunalua Bay in east Honolulu, O'ahu. Taking inspiration from the local flora, fauna, and more importantly waves, Kenny created some amazingly detailed and colorful illustrations of some epic surf spots. We’re super stoked to bring his island paradise back on full display with a returning classic shape in the Snapper, as well as perennial heavy hitters in the Striker and Maverick</p>
